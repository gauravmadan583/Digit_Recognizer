# Digit_Recognizer
Built a oneVsAll Logistic Regression Model using gradient descent with regularization. 
The dataset for the model is in this link https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data
The data contains 42000 training examples and 28000 test examples.
I choose the regularization parameter lambda by plotting precision with various value of lambda.
The Kaggle Score is 0.9/1
